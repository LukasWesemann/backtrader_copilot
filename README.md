# backtrader_copilot

### Goal

The goal of *backtrader_copilot* is to leverage the power of AI to make powerful quantitative backtesting more efficient for professionals, as well as making it available to amateurs who have great ideas but lack the technical skills to test them.

## Introduction

*backtrader_copilot* is an AI enabled no-code tool to conduct quantitative backtests for trading strategies.

backtrader is a popular python framework that enables algorithmic traders to backtest complex trading strategies on historical data.

Setting up quantitative backtests is a complex task that involves data selection and cleaning, strategy ideation, backtest implementation, strategy optimisation and evaluation of KPI's.

Backtrader is an excellent tool to support this. However, I see several limitations

- It's quite complex to set up backtests. Many concepts are not intuitively clear to beginners and there are many pitfalls.
- Quantiative backtesting is computationally intense. Writing efficient code is crucial, but how to achieve this is not always obvious.
- The speed at which trading strategy ideas can be translated into code is low.
- It is hard to get feedback on trading stragies and developing new ideas based on existing strategies can be cumbersome.

*backtrader_copilot* leverages large language models (LLM's) to:

- set up backtesting code according to natural language descriptions provided by the user
- identifies issues with provided strategies
- provides suggestions for improvements of strategies and data sources
- provides an intuitive UI for non-technical traders to use *backtrader_copilot*
